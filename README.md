# Face Mask Detection Project

## Introduction

This project is a simple face mask detection system using computer vision. The system captures video from the user's camera, detects faces, and predicts whether the person is wearing a mask or not. The model used for mask detection can be replaced with your own pre-trained model or a publicly available one.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Pre-trained face detection model (e.g., Haarcascades)
- Pre-trained face mask detection model (replace with your own or use a pre-trained one)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alwyn25/face_mask_detection.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and place the pre-trained face detection model in the project directory.

4. Download and place the pre-trained face mask detection model in the project directory.

## Usage

Run the following command to start the face mask detection system:


open mask_detection.ipynb in google colab or in Jupyter Notebook


Press 'esc' or 'q' to exit the camera stream.

## Customization

- Replace the pre-trained face detection model with your preferred one.
- Train your own face mask detection model or use a pre-trained one.
- Customize the display messages or actions based on mask detection results.
